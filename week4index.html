<h3>The Issue with Going off Route</h3>	
<p>In such a congested place like New York City, truck drivers are given designated routes to follow in order to avoid a variety of issues. Some drivers deter from these routes in order to save themselves time and money but, in doing so, can cause damage to streets, other vehicles and put the lives of others in danger by causing accidents. One area in particular is the Jamaica part of Queens. According to the 103rd precinct and residents, popular streets for drivers to take short cuts are 170th Street and 175th Street.
</p>
<h3>The Routes</h3>
<p>There are two types of routes designated by the Department of Transportation in NYC: the Through Route and the Local Route. The Through Route is if the destination and starting point of a driver are in two different boroughs or outside of the boroughs. The Local Route is for starting points and destinations within the same borough.</p>

<h3>Putting it all Together</h3>
<p>The following map depicts a combination of the routes truck drivers are supposed to follow and accidents occuring that involve commercial vehicles with the commercial vehicle as the first vehicle in the accident (meaning the one causing the accident). As you can see there is a high amount of accidents that occur outside of the designated routes. While not every driver who goes off route causes an accident, there is still a high amount of accidents occuring in residental areas. Residents, both as pedestrians and drivers, shouldn't have to worry about sharing the road with a commercial vehicle on such congested and small streets that aren't build to withstand such large vehicles.</p>
<p>While both types of commercial vehicles are causing accidents, a majority of it appears to be small commercial vehicles, meaning those with four wheels, are causing more accidents outside of the desginated routes. Perhaps this is because smaller commercial vehicles believe they can fit onto the narrow streets.</p>

<h3>Other Issues</h3>
<p>Some of the other issues involving commercial vehicles is drivers parking illegally either overnight or when making deliveries. The DOT website states "When parking is not otherwise restricted, no person shall park a commercial vehicle in any area, including a residential area, in excess of three hours." As for overnight parking, commercial vehicles are not allowed to park between 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. on residential streets. While some, but not all, truck companies offer overnight parking for their vehicles, for drivers at the ones that don't there are other options. There are eight commercial districts in NYC where drivers are allowed to park their vehicles overnight. There are also overnight parking lots that charge anywhere between $30 to $120 depending on both the size of the vehicle and length of time it is parked there for. While a $65 ticket could be less then the cost to park overnight at a lot, doesn't it look worse to have a high amount of parking tickets that the employeer has to then pay for? So far, I have not been able to get a comment from a driver or a company.

<h3>Police Response</h3>
<p>In response to the issue of commercial vehicles parking illegally and overnight the 103rd Precinct has a Traffic Safety Unit which conducts overnight commercial parking opperations. These are known as Heavy Tow Operations. During one such operation during the last week in October of 2015, the unit removed two trucks from the street, had 5 trucks booted and issued 31 summonses. A parking summons is a $65 fine which is issued to the company that owns the truck. 
<p>If drivers are found going off route by the police they receive a fine that increases with each infraction. The first offense is a minimum fine of $200, $500 for the second and $1,000 for the third. Two points are also added to the license of the driver for each offense. Truck companies have supported the NYPD in ticketing drivers who are disobeying the laws but police believe they could do more to stress the importance of staying on route to their drivers.</p>
