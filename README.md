# GoingOffRoute
<h3>How I did it all!</h3>
<p2>As I stated in the above under data, I found the information for the map at the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#truckroutes">DOT</a> website and <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">NYC OpenData</a>. The site I used to create the map was <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>. There I uploaded the files I got from the DOT (You should download the shp files and then simply upload the zipped folders to the website) and the filtered files on the Motor Vehicle Collisions. I made sure to separate the types of collisions into small and large commercial vehicles and color coded everything on an map legend. The site is pretty easy and user friendly when it comes to creating your own custom map. However it does require playing around with the site a bit to learn where everything is.</p>
