# GoingOffRoute
<h3>How I did it all!</h3>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The DOT provides copies of the two designated truck routes for all drivers as either hard copies or online files. The DOT also provides the datasets of the two routes which can be found <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#truckroutes">here</a>.</p>
<p>Details regarding Motor Vehicle Collisions is provided by the NYPD and can be found <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">here</a> on NYC OpenData. In order to find instances involving trucks or commercial vehicles, click the filter button, select Vehicle Type Code 1 and put in LARGE COM VEH(6 OR MORE TIRES). This gives you all instances involving large commercial vehicles. In order to find instances involving small commercial vehicles, repeat the process and instead type in SMALL COM VEH(4 TIRES). This data starts with incidents occuring in July of 2012 to February of 2016.</p>

<h3>Putting it together!</h3>
<p2>As I stated in the above, I found the information for the map at the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#truckroutes">DOT</a> website and <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">NYC OpenData</a>. The site I used to create the map was <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>. There I uploaded the files I got from the DOT (You should download the shp files and then simply upload the zipped folders to the website) and the filtered files on the Motor Vehicle Collisions. I made sure to separate the types of collisions into small and large commercial vehicles and color coded everything on an map legend. The site is pretty easy and user friendly when it comes to creating your own custom map. However it does require playing around with the site a bit to learn where everything is.</p>
